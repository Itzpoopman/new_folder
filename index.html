            Bryant in his debut NBA season mainly came off the bench for the Lakers and became both the youngest player and starter in league history.</li>
        <li>1998 - After becoming the youngest ever Slam Dunk Contest winner in 1997, Bryant goes on to play in the All-Star game a year later to become the youngest All-Star starter in history.</li>

        <li>2002 - Bryant leads The West to victory over The East in the 2002 All-Star game and was named All-Star MVP for the first time. He is to pick up that accolade again in 2007, 2009 and 2011.</li> 
        <li>2003 - Bryant's wife, Vanessa, gives birth to their first child, daughter Natalia. The couple have another three children. On July 18, Bryant is charged with one count of sexual assault in a case involving a 19-year-old hotel worker</li>

        <li>2013 - The couple publicly announce their reconciliation and remain married </li>
        <li>2014 - In a victory over Minnesota, Bryant reaches 32,310 career points to move into third on the NBA's all-time scoring list and overtake Michael Jordan's tally of 32,310.</li>
